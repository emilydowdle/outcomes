## Trends

Overall we are seeing:

* Consistently larger cohorts across the four modules.
* Few students are leaving the program without the intent to continue.
* Students who plan to take a module off are consistently returning and progressing through their studies.
* Module 1 is showing a higher-than-expected repeat rate.
* This is counterbalanced by a lower-than-normal dropout rate. Our suspicion is that our additional attention to student progress/wellbeing and support staffing/effort is turning some students who would have dropped out into repeaters. And those repeaters are generally progressing through the latter four modules.

## Enrollments & Admissions

* 1602, has 29 students which is a slight over-enrollment
versus our target of 28 students in M1 due to high repeat rate
Future cohort enrollments are weaker than we would like to see:
* 1603 has 11 students enrolled
* 1605 has 3 students enrolled
* 1606 has 1 student enrolled

Applications are inline with what we’ve seen in the past:

* Just 2 applications are awaiting evaluation
* 9 students have pending interviews
* 4 students have been invited but have not yet selected/enrolled in a cohort

This module we are working to build a better infrastructure for student recruitment. In addition we are excited to be developing new student pipelines including:

* partnering with Denver Community College on the EQUIP program
* expecting approval from the VA to accept GI Bill funding for vets & spouses
* working with several charitable organizations to facilitate admissions and support for persons with refugee status in the US from Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan

We’re also rebooting/growing existing efforts including:

* better scheduling of community night
* being more organized with publicizing student work (projects, blog posts, etc)
* cutting traditional media advertising
* finishing up the new website
* better publicizing the referral credit
* better publicizing our lending partners and particularly their ability to lend for student cost-of-living
* engaging with a public relations firm to increase media presence
* improving our jobs network/process which will also promote admissions

## Hiring

Hiring progress over the holidays was slow, overall, but has started to accelerate. We currently have:

* 20 students hunting for their first job offer
* Of those 12 graduated in the most recent cohort
* 5 graduated with the previous cohort
* 3 students are near or over 90 days of job hunting post-graduation
* 3 additional students are hunting for a second job
* 3 students have pending offers
* 2 students are experimenting with freelancing/contracting
* Overall 25 alumni are job hunting
* The 19 students in Module 4 begin job hunting this week

Overall our hiring mechanism continues to putter along. Students finding employment are almost evenly split between companies where a previous alum is working and companies new to our network. Of those new ones, Turing staff played a part in opening the door for over half of students.

The competitive landscape continues to look good:

* General Assembly is going to open a campus here in the coming months.
* Will likely lead to a growing potential student pool and open more employer doors
* Galvanize and other programs continue to operate locally without any particular impact/growth
* We consistently hear from employers “we’re not interested in hiring people from anywhere but Turing.”
* Turing grads consistently beat out people from other programs for the same job unless the other person has significant experience or a CS degree

We are currently interviewing candidates for an additional staff role to work on building out a robust hiring network. During this module, improving hiring is my #1 priority. My goals for the end of this module are to:
hire the additional staff member

* “clear” all 25 alumni from the job hunt board
* set up partnerships with at least two larger companies to hire students on an ongoing basis
* implement software tools to better track and share all our hiring data
* collect data from all alumni to build out a more robust outcomes report

## Staffing

From last module we have the following staffing changes:

* Horace takes over as the anchor for Module 1
* Nate joins the staff to support Horace in Module 1
* Mike moves to Module 1
* Rachel continues as anchor for M2 but is now supported by Andrew
* Josh Mejia continues as anchor for M3 but is now supported by Tess and Lovisa

Our current staffing needs include:

* Partnerships/Employment Manager (immediate)

## Academic & Program Changes

* Warmup time has been a consistent disappointment
* Perhaps undercutting the efficacy of posses
* Restructuring to focus on multi-day small assignments
* Allison is introducing “Protocol” sessions to intentionally build up both technical and non-technical communication
* Horace has built up a feedback application that runs over Slack to make feedback more of an every-day thing
* Cutting back on “Bed and Breakfast” amenities,
* reappropriating funds to instructional support

## What’s Next

* Launching the Front-End Engineering program
** First cohort starts in June
** Rolling cohorts from there
** Full enrollment by the end of the year
** Working on recruiting instructors and students now
** Shopping for a new space
** Likely 18,000 square feet somewhere in Downtown
** Trying to have a plan in place by the end of next week
* Two year mark this June.
** What hasn’t changed and should? Likely going to raise tuition to $20K
** Host a “homecoming weekend” type event for alumni
** With new space and staff, hoping to offer single module classes or nights & weekends
