## Trends

Overall we are seeing:

* things

## Enrollments & Admissions

### Enrollments Snapshot

* 1603 begins with 28 students, full enrollment

Future cohort enrollments for the primary program continue to be weaker than we'd like to see:

* 1603 has X students enrolled
* 1605 has X students enrolled
* 1606 has X students enrolled

We've also begun accepting enrollments for the Front End Engineering program.

* 1606 has X students enrolled
* 1608 has X students enrolled

### Applications Snapshot

Applications are inline with what we’ve seen in the past:

* X applications are awaiting evaluation
* X students have pending interviews
* X students have been invited but have not yet selected/enrolled in a cohort

### Enrollments/Applications Pipelines

This module we are working to build a better infrastructure for student recruitment. In addition we are excited to be developing new student pipelines including:

* partnering with Denver Community College on the EQUIP program
* expecting approval from the VA to accept GI Bill funding for vets & spouses
* working with several charitable organizations to facilitate admissions and support for persons with refugee status in the US from Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan

We’re also rebooting/growing existing efforts including:

* better scheduling of community night
* being more organized with publicizing student work (projects, blog posts, etc)
* cutting traditional media advertising
* finishing up the new website
* better publicizing the referral credit
* better publicizing our lending partners and particularly their ability to lend for student cost-of-living
* engaging with a public relations firm to increase media presence
* improving our jobs network/process which will also promote admissions

## Student Employment

### Jobs & Job Hunters

We currently have:

* X students hunting for their first job offer
* Of those X graduated in the most recent cohort
* X graduated with the previous cohort
* X students are near or over 90 days of job hunting post-graduation
* X additional students are hunting for a second job
* X students have pending offers
* X students are experimenting with freelancing/contracting
* Overall X alumni are job hunting
* The X students in Module 4 begin job hunting this week

### Our Structures/Processes

Overall our hiring mechanism continues to putter along. Students finding employment are almost evenly split between companies where a previous alum is working and companies new to our network. Of those new ones, Turing staff played a part in opening the door for over half of students.

We are currently interviewing candidates for an additional staff role to work on building out a robust hiring network. During this module, improving hiring is my #1 priority. My goals for the end of this module are to:
hire the additional staff member

### Competitive Landscape

The competitive landscape continues to look good:

* General Assembly is going to open a campus here in the coming months.
* Will likely lead to a growing potential student pool and open more employer doors
* Galvanize and other programs continue to operate locally without any particular impact/growth
* We consistently hear from employers “we’re not interested in hiring people from anywhere but Turing.”
* Turing grads consistently beat out people from other programs for the same job unless the other person has significant experience or a CS degree

### Goals

* “clear” all 25 alumni from the job hunt board
* set up partnerships with at least two larger companies to hire students on an ongoing basis
* implement software tools to better track and share all our hiring data
* collect data from all alumni to build out a more robust outcomes report

## Staffing

* Horace takes over as the anchor for Module 1
* Nate joins the staff to support Horace in Module 1
* Mike moves to Module 1
* Rachel continues as anchor for M2 but is now supported by Andrew
* Josh Mejia continues as anchor for M3 but is now supported by Tess and Lovisa

* I am stepping back from teaching for the module to focus on operations
* Josh Cheek leaves us for a four-month project in Chicago
* Rachel Martinez will soon be taking maternity leave
* Jeff Ruane from 1507 joins us on a part-time fellowship for the module doing direct student support noon-to-8pm on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday

Our current staffing needs include:

* ~6 lead and supporting instructors for the front end program

## Academic & Program Changes

* Warmup time has been a consistent disappointment
* Perhaps undercutting the efficacy of posses
* Restructuring to focus on multi-day small assignments
* Allison is introducing “Protocol” sessions to intentionally build up both technical and non-technical communication
* Horace has built up a feedback application that runs over Slack to make feedback more of an every-day thing
* Cutting back on “Bed and Breakfast” amenities,
* reappropriating funds to instructional support

## Achievements

* Office Lease
* Outcomes report

## What’s Next


### Two year mark this June.

* Host a “homecoming weekend” type event for alumni
* With new space and staff, hoping to offer single module classes or nights & weekends
