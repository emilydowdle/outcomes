## Trends & News

Things of interest to have on your radar:

* We released the 2015 Outcomes Report with data from 135 students. Highlights included an 83% satisfactory outcomes rate, 96% finding employment within 120 days, and average salary of $75K.
* Close to signing the office lease for expected occupancy this June. It'll be just five blocks from our current location.

## Enrollments & Admissions

### Enrollments Snapshot

* 1603 begins with 28 students, full enrollment

Future cohort enrollments for the primary program continue to be weaker than we'd like to see:

* 1605 has 14 students enrolled
* 1606 has 2 students enrolled
* 1608 has 6 students enrolled

### Applications Snapshot

Applications are inline with what we’ve seen in the past:

* 0 applications are awaiting evaluation
* 10 students have pending interviews
* ~6 students have been invited but have not yet selected/enrolled in a cohort

### Enrollments/Applications Pipelines

Last module we set out to build a better infrastructure for student recruitment and
develop new pipelines. We've made some progress, but not as much as we'd hoped:

* our letter of intent for the Department of Education's EQUIP program in partnership
with Denver Community College was denied based on DCC's struggles with student graduation rates
* we have good indicators from the VA to accept GI Bill funding for vets & spouses once we hit the two-year mark this summer
* progress has been slow in the effort to bring in and support refugee students
* one or our advisors, Morris Price, has become the Executive Director of City Year in Colorado and we're working out ways for Turing to be a next-step after City Year and to recruit from their community

We've improved some of our existing pipelines by:

* scheduled out two community nights per module
* rebuilt the main website, though it still needs editing
* spending a significant amount of time on direct outreach to companies and individuals to "build the network"

## Student Employment

### Jobs & Job Hunters

We currently have:

* 26 students hunting for their first job offer
* Of those 16 graduated in the most recent cohort
* 7 graduated with the previous cohort
* 3 students are near or over 90 days of job hunting post-graduation
* 5 additional students are hunting for a second job
* Overall 31 alumni are job hunting
* The 24 students in Module 4 begin job hunting this week
* A total of 55 job hunters

### Our Structures/Processes

I invested a lot of time and energy into improving the jobs picture this past module
without a ton of success.

Overall 1508 had fewer jobs by graduation than previous cohorts. In many cases
this was an intentional delay to focus on their studies. Several students have
or are imminently expecting offers. Overall I am not concerned about them.

During Marissa's maternity leave Jorge and I are helping with more student-side
job support. We're also talking with a contractor to help with resume and cover
letter editing.

Most importantly, we've hired the Partnerships Manager we've been hunting for since
September. She'll be starting in late April.

### Competitive Landscape

The competitive landscape is complicated:

* We've learned that General Assembly, The Iron Yard, and DevBootcamp are all opening
Denver campuses this year
* Some of our local competitors have been struggling with poor student and employer feedback
* Local companies continue to tell us that they favor Turing graduates over other interviewees

### Goals

* “clear” all 31 graduated alumni from the job hunt board
* set up partnerships with at least two larger companies to hire students on an ongoing basis
* make a plan for how we're going to track alumni data on a smoother, ongoing basis

## Staffing

Our modules staffing has changed a bit:

* Module 1 is again anchored by Horace with support from Mike and Lovisa
* Module 2 is now anchored by Andrew with support from Rachel
* Module 3 is again anchored by Josh M with support from Nate
* Module 4 is anchored by Meeka with support from Steve and Tess

Jorge and I will continue to focus on operations and non-instructional jobs.
I'll teach one or two lessons in each module.

Other notes:

* Josh Cheek is still in Chicago and looks to return about June
* Rachel Martinez and Marissa are both out on maternity leave
* Jeff Ruane from 1507 completed the student support fellowship and is now starting his job hunt
* Jhun de Andres from 1508 has taken over the student support fellowship
* Louisa Barrett from my second gSchool class is currently part-time and ramping up to full time soon

Our current staffing needs include:

* ~5 lead and supporting instructors for the front end program

## Academic & Program Changes

### Posse Reboot

* We're remixing how posses work
* Past structures have been effective for some groups, but others break down
* Animosity between students who participate and those who don't
* Redesigned as an opt-in system
* 10 new posses each led by two current students
* Free to pick their own meeting schedule, in-person/remote, and areas of interest
* Later today you'll have the posse descriptions and a survey
* If you want to be in a posse you'll fill out the survey tonight
* Tomorrow we'll organize them and post the results
* Mentors will then have the opportunity to choose a posse or have us pick for them

### Protocol

* Weeks 1-4 are going to be per-module sessions, M1 in week 1, M2 in week 2, etc
* Week 5 will be all together
* Smaller groupings to help focus and communication

## What’s Next

* I'm going to have one more module of admin work to push more of these efforts forward
* New staff starting soon
* Looking at a “homecoming weekend” type event for alumni near Steve's DinosaurJS
